	Abstract = {The purpose of this protocol is to describe field methods for the consistent 
collection of salmonid redd abundance and subsequent estimation of adult 
salmonid breeding population size. We recommend surveys be conducted on 
predetermined, 3--5-km long stream reaches, using a spatially balanced rotating 
panel design. We suggest an annual draw of 10% of all reaches in the sampling 
universe as the target goal for monitoring; furthermore, to account for access 
problems and other barriers to sampling, we recommend that the initial sample 
draw should over-select reaches (sampling rate of 25%) to provide flexibility in the 
field. One field survey should occur prior to fish entering the spawning areas, with 
surveys thereafter conducted 7--14 d apart until new fish and redds are no longer 
observed. Surveyors will need to recognize that stream flows and/or weather 
conditions will have some bearing on the temporal aspects of surveys. All redds 
will be identified to species, measured, and georeferenced. Redd longevity and 
observer efficiency in redd detection will be estimated for each watershed by 
tracking the condition of individual redds measured during previous surveys. To 
document sex ratios, the sex of all live fish will be visually identified on behaviors 
at redds or other visual cues (dead fish will be identified, sexed, inspected for 
tags, and measured, per the carcass count protocol, page 59). In situations where 
multiple salmonid species overlap on a given spawning area, redd sizes will help 
differentiate the species involved.},

@article{Millar2012,
	Abstract = {If observed numbers of spawning salmon are plotted against sampling date, then the area under the curve (AUC) gives an estimate of spawner-days. Dividing AUC by spawner lifetime and adjusting for observer efficiency gives an estimate of spawner escapement. In particular, the trapezoidal form of AUC estimator has been widely used over the last two decades, despite the absence of a direct method for calculating its variance. For this reason, an alternative estimator of escapement was developed using a maximum likelihood (ML) model of spawner arrivals. However, this alternative has not been widely used, perhaps because of its complexity and concerns over validity of assumptions. Here, a simpler ML approach is used to estimate AUC by fitting a model directly to spawner numbers. It can be fitted using existing generalized linear modeling software and provides an explicit variance estimator for AUC and escapement. Simulations show that it has consistently higher coverage than the existing ML estimator. However, the trapezoidal AUC estimator was generally a slightly more precise estimator of escapement than either of the ML approaches.},
