This repository contains the data and code for our paper:

> Murdoch, A. R. and Herring, C. J. and Frady, C. H. and See, K. E. and
> Jordan, C. E., (2018). *Estimating observer error and steelhead redd
> abundance using a modified Gaussian area-under-the-curve framework*.
> Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences
> <https://doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2017-0335>

It also contains data and code demonstrating how this model has been
used to estimate redds, using predictions of redd observer error. These
estimates of redds are translated to estimates of spawners, and divided
into natural origin and hatchery origin spawners, based on data from a
separate [project](https://github.com/KevinSee/DabomPriestRapidsSthd)
using PIT tagged steelhead to estimates escapement to various areas in
the Upper Columbia. The reports are contained in the “outoing/reports”
folder that is available after cloning or downloading this compendium.
